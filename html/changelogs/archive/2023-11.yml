      helmet's unhatted state when they spot the captain, in their MODsuit, wearing
      a hat on their helmet. The embarrassment has resulted in more than a few operatives
      prematurely detonating their implants! BUT NO LONGER! FASHION IS YOURS!
  - qol: There is now a Core Gear Box, containing a few essential pieces of gear for
      success as an operative. This is right at the top of the uplink, you can't miss
      it! Great for those operatives just starting out, or operatives who need all
