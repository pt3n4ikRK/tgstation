  - qol: Clicking on an adjacent dense object (or mob) with Spray Cleaner will now
      spritz it rather than doing nothing. This means you can use Spray Cleaner to

      fill a spray bottle with Napalm, I guess.

  - bugfix: Galactic material market will deny appending stacks to your existing order
      if it exceeds the available (private or cargo depending on the mode of ordering)
      budget & if it exceeds the available materials on the market. Galactic material

      helmets FOR FREE. No longer does any operative need be shamed by their bald
      helmet's unhatted state when they spot the captain, in their MODsuit, wearing
      a hat on their helmet. The embarrassment has resulted in more than a few operatives
      prematurely detonating their implants! BUT NO LONGER! FASHION IS YOURS!
  - qol: There is now a Core Gear Box, containing a few essential pieces of gear for
      success as an operative. This is right at the top of the uplink, you can't miss
      it! Great for those operatives just starting out, or operatives who need all
      their baseline equipment NOW.
  - qol: To avoid poor magazine discipline, most combat-ready personnel have instructed
      _not_ to put magazines into the gun loops on their armor vests.
